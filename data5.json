Bucking convention and driven by a passion to create the ultimate gaming experience, Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian founded 1047 Games in 2017 in their Stanford dorm room. Their love for arena shooters of the past drove them to create Splitgate, a unique sci-fi first-person shooter that adds portal guns to upend the genre. \n\nWhat started as two computer science majors putting portals into a first-person shooter for a project demo has evolved into a VC-backed company which has raised more than $120MM in funding. \n\nAt 1047 Games, you\u2019ll find a permanently remote, dedicated team of top-tier talent from some of the world\u2019s biggest gaming and tech companies who share our founders\u2019 vision. Grit, ingenuity, a desire to have fun, and a start up mentality define our crew. And we\u2019re just getting started.",
